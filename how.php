							<br><br>There are lots of ways you can help promote donation-n your community, at school, at work and where you worship.
							<br>Workplace Partnership for Life (WPFL)
							<br><br>The WPFL brings together the federal government, the organ donation community, and businesses of all kinds to spread the word about donor registration. Their goal is help America become "donation-friendly"-through education and opportunities for people to sign up. WPFL partners have helped to register over 580,000 organ, eye, and tissue donors.
							<br><br>Join the Campus Challenge
							<br>This campaign brings local organ and tissue donation groups together with colleges, universities, and other post-high school campuses. As a Campus Challenge Partner, you can help spread the word about the great need for organ and tissue donors.
							<br><br>Join the WPFL Hospital Campaign
							<br>This program brings together hospitals, medical groups and other health care organizations with local donation groups. As a Hospital Campaign Partner, you can help let others know how they can "let life bloom" by signing up in their state donor registries.
