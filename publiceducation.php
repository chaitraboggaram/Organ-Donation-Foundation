</table>
Investigators at Claremont Graduate University, in collaboration with the Donor Network of Arizona, will replicate and extend a letter-based direct mail campaign in a target population of 16-18 year old Arizona residents (vs. 18 year-olds in Illinois in the original study).  Results of the original project indicated that the letter alone elicited a similar registration rate (6.24%) as the letter plus brochure (6.30%) and the rate was significantly greater than that of the brochure alone (3.30%).  In the current project, an initial campaign wave will directly replicate the original project (official letter vs. letter plus brochure vs. brochure only).  A second wave will assess the impact of an enhanced letter compared to the letter (Standard Letter) used in the Wave 1.  The enhanced letter, based on self-determination theory, will include material emphasizing the readers’ transition to adulthood and support for independent decision-making.  A third wave will assess the impact of a second enhanced letter compared to the Standard letter.  This letter, also drawn from self-determination theory, will include materials emphasizing family and social support for organ donation decisions.  An additional aspect of this last wave is that parents of the targeted audience will also receive a letter encouraging their support of their children’s organ donation decisions.  The modifications are designed to build on the theoretical processes proposed to underlie the original project so as to further enhance the impact of a direct mail campaign for youth in transition to adulthood—namely by enhancing needs for autonomy.

<br>The current project utilizes a multi-message, phased driver facility campaign featuring (a) clerk training, (b) point-of-decision materials, and (c) video monitors strategically placed inside Chicago driver facilities to disseminate organ and tissue donation messages.  By varying the order of the intervention arms, the research team will be able to test the effectiveness of each arm individually as well as in conjunction with each of the other components.  By utilizing both control and intervention driver facilities, the team can determine if organ donation registration trends observed during the eight-month campaign are due to the intervention arms or an environmental confound or secular trend.  In addition to testing the effectiveness of each intervention arm on organ donor registrations, the evaluation strategy will empirically account for exposure to each intervention arm.  Perhaps more importantly, the current driver facilities campaign will reach approximately 82% of African-American and 90% of Hispanic Illinois residents.

	</tr>
</table>
This project will implement and test a new approach to tailoring media and community outreach campaigns to target particular groups.  Specifically, the research team will use data mining techniques to construct a "deep profile" of people who have not designated themselves as organ donors.  The deep profile will enable the team to craft messages about organ donation that appeal to people based on a wide range of personal attributes.  This technique will help  overcome a key limitation of the traditional approach to message development and testing.  That is, "targets" are usually grouped into broad demographic categories, e.g., by gender, race, age or geography.  Large scale data mining, on the other hand, will allow comparison of donors and non-donors on literally thousands of data points in a wide range of categories and consumer preferences: entertainment, media consumption, politics and ideology, current events, health and fitness, brand preferences, shopping habits, personal finance, technology use, celebrity preferences and lifestyle. It is hypothesized that by crafting messages that appeal to subjects with which non-donors express an affinity, the research team will be able to motivate pro-donation behavior.  These profiles will be used to plan and execute campaigns in three segments: health and fitness, faith-based, and grass roots events.=

	</tr>
</table>
The long-term goal of this program is to increase rates of organ donation by substantially increasing the proportion of licensed drivers in New England who are registered organ donors. The objective of this project is to further disseminate and evaluate a targeted division of motor vehicle (DMV) office campaign to increase donor registry enrollment in New England. Based upon a HRSA study that demonstrated the effectiveness of the DMV-based intervention, this project will evaluate its dissemination in other regions of New England as a logical extension of the research program. The central hypothesis is that the educational outreach will yield higher rates of donor registry enrollment by DMV customers (compared to pre-intervention rates) in Rhode Island. The rationale for the proposed research is that it is important to establish whether effective DMV-based education strategies can be disseminated with the same level of effectiveness in other states with different population parameters and DMV processes. To evaluate our central hypothesis, two specific aims will be pursued: 1) To determine the effectiveness of an educational outreach program in DMV offices in Rhode Island, and 2) To evaluate the impact of the educational outreach program on organ donor registration rates in census tracts with low donation rates. The expected outcomes of this study will yield valuable information regarding the dissemination of effective DMV-based strategies in increasing donor registry enrollment in Rhode Island.

This study seeks to replicate an empirically validated intervention by identifying the most effective medium and message framing strategies to encourage 50-64-year-old African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic adults to join the Illinois, Iowa, or New York organ donor registries. The grantee will conduct a stratified (by race) random mail survey to identify current beliefs with respect to (a) bodily integrity, disgust, superstitions, and medical mistrust, (b) selfefficacy, knowledge of the need for more registered organ donors, and (c) message framing preferences for each ethnicity. From this information, in year 1, they will randomly distribute mailers to individuals by way of a (a) personalized letter, (b) brochure featuring organ donors, organ recipients, and people awaiting an organ transplant, or (c) both the letter and brochure. In year 2, they will select the most effective medium from year 1, but this time individuals (N = 300,000) will be randomly assigned to a mailer emphasizing the perspective of (a) organ donors, (b) organ recipients, (c) persons on a waiting list, or a (d) combination of the aforementioned frames. Together, the proposed project will replicate a successful HRSA-funded project while extending the reach.

The goal of this intervention is to increase the number of patients who enroll in the state donor registry and inform their family. It is a replication of an empirically validated intervention providing education through an electronic health information exchange system. This project will utilize HEALTHeLINK, an electronic health information exchange system, to provide patients with access to a web based multimedia education program on organ donation and access to donor registry enrollment linked to their secure personal health record patient portal. A multifaceted web based education program using different modalities for the delivery of information will be used to provide information on organ donation to patients assigned to the intervention. This will include narrated programs, a video of physicians discussing the importance of making an informed decision about donation and registry enrollment, recipients and donor family testimonials and printable education materials. Patients will be encouraged to enroll in the registry via this site and forward information about their commitment to donate to family members and to their primary care physician.

This approach is intended not only to reach large numbers of people in a cost- effective way, but also to overcome the gap inherent in traditional public education between the time people receive a message about donation and when they are in a position to take action. By placing a link to the online registry within the game itself, people will be able to designate themselves as donor without significant additional effort.
