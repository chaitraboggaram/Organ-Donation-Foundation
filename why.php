<br><br>Because you may save up to 8 lives through organ donation and enhance many others through tissue donation. 
<br><br>Last year alone, organ donors made more than 28,000 transplants possible. Another one million people received cornea and other tissue transplants that helped them recover from trauma, bone damage, spinal injuries, burns, hearing impairment and vision loss.
<br><br>Unfortunately, thousands die every year waiting for a donor organ that never comes. You have the power to change that.

						<br><br>During your visit to organdonor.gov someone may have been added to the waiting list. It happens every 10 minutes! Each day, about 79 people receive organ transplants. However, 22 people die each day waiting for transplants that can't take place because of the shortage of donated organs. Organ transplantation has become an accepted medical treatment for end stage organ failure. The facts prove it! But only you can help make it happen!
