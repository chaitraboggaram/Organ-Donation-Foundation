<br><br><br><br><b>Heart-</b>A muscular organ that pumps blood through the body. The heart can be donated and transplanted.
<br><br><b>Heart Valves-</b>Prevent the back flow or leakage of blood as it is being pumped through the chambers inside of the heart. Heart valves can be donated and transplanted.
<br><br><b>Hemodialysis-</b>A treatment for kidney failure in which the patient's blood is passed through a filtering membrane to remove excess fluid and wastes.
<br><br><b>Histocompatibility-</b>The examination or testing of antigens to determine if a donor organ will "match" and be compatible with a potential recipient's system. This routine test is often called tissue-typing and helps identify the most suitable recipient for a donated organ.
<br><br><b>Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA)-</b>A genetically determined series of markers (molecules) located on human white blood cells (leukocytes) and on tissues that are inherited from both biological parents. HLA matching is important for compatibility between donor and recipient.
