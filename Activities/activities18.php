<br><br>The 32nd Transplant Coordinators' Training Programme was successfully held from 31st August to 4th September 2015 at TERI auditorium, Bengaluru. MOHAN Foundation conducted this programme on the invitation of Manipal Hospitals. There were participants from the Manipal Hospitals group - Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Goa and Bengaluru. In addition, there were also participants from other hospitals in Dharwad, Mysuru, Jalandhar, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Tamil Nadu. In total, there were 31 participants who attended the one week training programme.
<br><br>The training programme was inaugurated by Dr. Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman - Medical Advisory Board & Medical Director - Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. He said that the deceased donation programme was moving forward with the support of state agencies, NGOs like MOHAN Foundation and the media. He wished the participants a successful training.
<br><br>The faculty comprised Dr. A Olithselvan (Liver Transplantation & Hepatology), Dr. Paritosh Pandey (Neurosurgery), Dr. Geetha (Intensive Care), Dr. Vishwanath S. (Nephrology) -all from Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru, Dr. Julius Punnen from Narayana Hrudayalaya, and Mrs. Lalitha Raghuram, Dr. Sumana Navin, Mrs. Sujatha Niranjan, Ms. Akshatha from MOHAN Foundation. The guest lecture by Mr. Sanjay Sahay, IPS on medical-legal/ethical issues was thought provoking, energising and informative. He said that Registered Medical Practitioners together with transplant coordinators were the catalysts in organ donation. He added that the Transplantation of Human Organs Act was noble in intent, but poor in execution/enforcement, so the problem was not the 'Act', but the decision not to 'act'. He urged the transplant coordinators to keep their eyes open so that they could help the government and their hospitals.
<br><br>Dr.  A. Olithselvan, Chairman-Division of Liver Transplantation and Consultant Hepatologist gave away the certificates to the participants at the valedictory function. He was very happy with the enthusiastic participation of the group in the training. He said it was a pleasure to associate with MOHAN Foundation with the goal of promoting organ donation in the country and added that this programme would help them kick-start the process.
<br><br>One of the participants summed up the training experience in the feedback form by saying, "The training programme was excellent and I personally feel that I got a golden chance to improve my skills to do the best."
