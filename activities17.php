<br><br>Jeevanvileena, an organ donation campaign conceptualised and launched by A. J. Hospital & Research Centre (AJHRC), had its grand finale on Saturday 10th October 2015 at the A. J. Institute of Medical Sciences Auditorium, Mangalore. During the 20-day campaign, there were street plays by NSS students of Mangalore University, mime and dance performances on the theme, and an awareness rally. The Chief Guest at the valedictory function was Mr. U. T. Khadar, Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of Karnataka. MOHAN Foundation was represented at the function by Dr. Sumana Navin, Course Director; this was in recognition of the Foundation's concerted efforts in spreading the message of organ donation for close to two decades.
<br><br>Jeevanvileena, which means Continuing Lives is in memory of the first two deceased donors not just in AJHRC, but in Mangalore - Jeevan and Leena. Dr. Prashant Marla, Medical Director & Consultant Urologist, AJHRC, said that four lives were saved through the remarkable act of organ donation by the families of Jeevan and Leena.
<br><br>Dr. Sunil P. Shenoy, Head of the Department, Urology spoke about the enormity of the problem of end-stage renal disease in India and that deceased organ donation could help solve it to a great extent. He added that the people of Dakshina Kannada were socially aware and sought the support of the government and sister institutions to take this forward in the region.
<br><br>The Chief Guest, Mr. U. T. Khadar, Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of Karnataka in his address said that rigorous awareness campaigns on organ donation were needed to change mental attitudes, customs and traditions regarding the concept. He spoke about the importance of having committees to declare brain death in hospitals and counsellors to talk to families about organ donation.
<br><br>Dr. Sumana Navin in her address said that cooperation among all the stakeholders and transparency in organ allocation were essential ingredients of a successful deceased organ donation and transplantation programme. She added that tissue/organ donation needed to become a part of everyday vocabulary. 
<br><br>Ms. Shalini, a kidney transplant recipient, spoke about how her life was 'normal' once more, something that many people take for granted. Ms. Anna Crasta whose family pledged for organ donation on the occasion of her parents' 30th wedding anniversary said that it was a social obligation that everyone needed to fulfill.
<br><br>The valedictory function ended with two special performances. The 'Yakshagana' performance was spectacular - an age-old tradition melding with the new-age concept of organ transplantation. The S. D. M College students through their innovative street theatre and mime performances effectively communicated the message of organ donation to an enthusiastic audience.
<br><br>The Jeevanvileena campaign was put together by the HR Department and Transplant Coordinators (Ms. Laveena & Ms. Soumya) of AJHRC.
