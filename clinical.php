<b>Grantee:</b>	The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco
<br><b>Grant #:</b>	R38OT22183
<br><b>Consortium Members:</b>	OneLegacy, California Transplant Donors Network, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
<br><b>Project Title:</b>	The Effect of Therapeutic Hypothermia on Deceased Donor Renal Graft Outcomes - a Randomized Controlled Trial from the Region 5 Donor Management Goals Workgroup
<br><b>Description:</b>	Active medical interventions tested prospectively, in order to protect donor organs, hold great potential to decrease the organ supply-demand          imbalance. Such studies remain rare.  Additionally, compliance with pre-defined donor goals to stabilize the physiologic functions of donor organs remains low across different donation service areas (DSA) despite evidence that these protocols may improve organ yield. The goals of the proposal are to demonstrate that the following two interventions can improve allograft function and survival: (1) therapeutic hypothermia as an active medical intervention for the Neurologic Death Donor, and (2) compliance with DMG's. These goals are to  be accomplished by bringing together a  research network extending over several DSA's and using the power of the network to conduct a  prospective randomized single blinded trial hypothesizing that therapeutic hypothermia applied to a neurological determination of death donor is renal protective.

<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in deceased Organ Donors
<br><b>Description:</b>	Interventions that have the potential to either increase the number of transplantable organs and/or improve the function of transplanted organs may decrease organ donor supply-demand imbalance. Brief periods of skeletal muscle limb ischemia via remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may induce protection against prolonged ischemia in distant organs via production of anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic compounds which counteract the inflammatory mediators released in brain death. The goals of the clinical trial are (1) to show that RIPC induced soon after neurological determination of death (NDD),  and consent for donation, increases the number of organs recovered and transplanted per donor; (2) to demonstrate that RIPC implemented soon after neurological determination of death (NDD) improves circulatory stability, renal, myocardial and pulmonary function as well as perfusion parameters in machine preserved kidneys from those donors; and (3) to show that RIPC would improve early post transplant clinical outcomes in recipients of NDD organs.

<br><b>Consortium Members:</b>	University of Michigan, Henry Ford Health System, Spectrum Health-Butterworth Hospital
<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Evaluation and Expansion of the use of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECS) for Controlled Organ Donation Following Cardiac Death
<br><b>Description:</b>	Extracorporeal Life Support is felt to be a promising solution to the logistical issues of Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) with the potential to improve outcomes by limiting ischemia and possibly resuscitating organs. The investigators hope to define the advantage that ECS offers over conventional DCD organ recovery and refine the procedure so that it can be used at hospitals lacking ECS programs. Aims include: 1. to determine organ yield transplanted per donor for ECS-DCD donors compared to rapid recovery DCD and Donation after Brain Death (DBD), 2. to compare outcomes of livers and kidneys transplanted from ECS-DCD donors to rapid recovery DCD and DBD donors and 3. to compare potential donor family as well as healthcare worker perceptions and attitudes to ECS-DCD versus rapid recovery DCD and DBD

<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Enhancing Donor after Circulatory Death (DCD) Utilization with Thrombolytic Therapy
<br><b>Description:</b>	The investigators intend to evaluate approaches to DCD procurement utilizing the thrombolytic agent tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) given the hypothesis that modulation of intravascular thrombosis by the use of rTPA will improve DCD kidney and liver function and prognosis. Although clinical outcome is the most important endpoint, testing will be performed to validate objective, verifiable and replicable laboratory measurements that may shed light on the mechanistic effect of these interventions

<br><b>Consortium Members:</b>	University of Pittsburgh and nine Organ Procurement Organizations
<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Monitoring Organ Donors to Improve Transplantation Results (MOnIToR)
<br><b>Description:</b>	Fifty percent of organ donors are under fluid resuscitated after brain death. These donors have been previously demonstrated to have a higher inflammatory response and donate fewer organs. Plans involve a large multicenter study of 960 brain dead organ donors to protocolize resuscitation with a continuous hemodynamic monitoring platform or usual care. Three objectives: 1) conduct trial and test whether protocolized care improves number of organs for transplantation; 2) measure IL-6 over time as a pro-inflammatory response marker and test whether protocolized resuscitation decreases IL-6; 3) test feasibility of protocol administration in the community hospital setting where the majority of organ donation occurs

<br><b>Consortium Members:</b>	Univ of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Baylor College of Medicine
<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Nutritional Status and Enteral Absorption Capability after Brain Death
<br><b>Description:</b>	Improving nutritional status of potential donors after declared brain dead could favorably impact organ procurement. Preliminary work shows increase IL-6 and TNF alpha in unfed donors and a correlation with improved graft survival in recipients with a lower IL-6. Half of a group of 36 donors are to be randomized to nutritional supplement. Through improved organ function and/or suppression of inflammatory cytokine production more organs are expected to be appropriate for procurement/transplantation and the risk of rejection reduced.

<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Intensive Insulin Therapy in Deceased Donors-to Improve Renal Allograft Function and Transplanted Allograft Outcomes
<br><b>Description:</b>	Intensive insulin therapy after neurological determination of death should decrease kidney injury and improve renal function at time of recovery. Previous retrospective analysis revealed hyperglycemia in Donation after Neurological Determination of Death (DNDD) is associated with decreased terminal renal function. Intensive insulin Rx (ITT) in ICUs are reported to be renal protective compared to standard Rx. The investigators plan a prospective observational study to measure impact of ITT on acute kidney injury in DNDD and allograft function in recipients and correlate evaluated biochemical markers of kidney function and health to develop more refined methods of predicting transplant success.

<br><b>Project Title:</b>	Hypothermic Machine Preservation of Extended Criteria Liver Allografts for Transplantation
<br><b>Description:</b>	Establish efficacy of continuous hypothermic machine preservation (MP) in transplantation of Extended Criteria Donor (ECD) livers. The investigators hypothesize this will increase utilization of existing ECD cadaver livers by increasing preservation, quality and improving early graft function. Outcome measures include: 1) graft survival at 30, 60, 90 days and 1 year, 2) preservation injury via graft histology, ultrastructure and serum markers of early graft function, 3) vascular and biliary complications and 4) ICU and hospital length of stay. Outcomes will be compared to 24 historical controls who received livers preserved with cold storage techniques.
