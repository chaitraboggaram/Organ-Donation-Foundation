<br><br>The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policies and bylaws govern the procedural aspects of policy development, allocation of donated organs, and the collection of transplant data nationwide. The public is included in the process through solicitation of feedback through a public comment process.
<br><br>OPTN committees and the OPTN board of directors develop policies, and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which holds the federal contract to operate the OPTN, is responsible for coordinating committee and board actions.

<br><br><b>Note:</b> Policies and bylaws must be forwarded for review and approval by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to become binding under the authority of federal regulation. The current OPTN policies and bylaws have not undergone this process and are voluntary. However, the requirements specified in the OPTN Final Rule are mandatory and enforceable by HHS.
<h4 style="color: #191970;">Policy Development</h4>
Continuing scientific and technological advances in organ transplantation require ongoing allocation policy refinements. Policies evolve to ensure that patients benefit from the best possible solutions.
