<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The main objective of the Organ Donor Foundation is to create awareness around the subject of organ donation and to register as many as possible individuals as organ donors. 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe number of organs donors registering indicates the success of specific awareness campaigns. Registering organ donors is important and should be considered as the basis and motivation for the majority of awareness projects undertaken. The Organ Donor Foundation is not a medical organisation and therefore not involved in the allocation or procurement of organs or any medical processes involved in transplantation. 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe are a non-profit organisation and we generate all our funding from the goodwill of individual and businesses. The Organ Donor Foundation requires funding to support its awareness projects and we welcome any events with the objective to raise funds for the Organ Donor Foundation.</big>

<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDespite rapid economic growth 9,00,000 newborn children die in India every year.  This means more than one child dying every minute.
 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnder-nutrition, respiratory infections, lack of immunisation and health facilities are the underlying causes of these newborn deaths. However, most of these deaths are preventable, if you choose to support us in our efforts to ensure that every child born gets the best start in life.
 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe challenge is tough. But a minute of your time and a little support every month is all that it takes to turn it around. Join us by becoming a Guardian of Hope today.
 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSupport us in our efforts to implement long-term, sustainable initiatives to help children through all the stages of their lives.
 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter all, life is the most beautiful gift you can give to a child.
 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHelp save a life by sparing a minute to pledge your support. Make your minute count! </big><br><br>
