<br><br><b>January:</b> National Volunteer Blood Donor Month
<br>A time to highlight the importance of giving life through the donation of blood and to honor past and present donors and encourage new ones. The theme, Give Bloodâ€¦The Gift of Life, is as constant as the need for blood.
<br><br><b>February 14:</b> National Donor Day
<br>Focused on five points of life: organs, tissues, marrow, platelets, and blood. Many nonprofit health organizations sponsor blood and marrow drives and organ/tissue sign-ups across the nation. National Donor Day was started in 1998 by the Saturn Corporation and its United Auto Workers partners with the support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and many nonprofit health organizations.
<br><br><b>April:</b> National Donate Life Month
<br>Organ procurement organizations, transplant centers, national donation organizations and other organizations sponsor special awareness events and donor recognition ceremonies to promote donation awareness and registration. National Donate Life Month was established in 2003. Every day in April, people across the U.S. make a special effort to celebrate the tremendous generosity of those who have saved lives by becoming organ, tissue, marrow, and blood donors and to encourage more Americans to follow their fine example.
