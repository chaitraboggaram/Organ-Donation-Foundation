<br><br>On 29, February 2016, MOHAN Foundation conducted an awareness session for the students of third year law. The chairperson of the department Mr.Vijay Nagpal was very supportive of the cause and appreciates MOHAN Foundation. Dr Shipra arranged the session for her students and she is also a guide for the students researching on "Organ Trafficking."
<br><br>There were around 50 students who participated in the session and were given a presentation on Organ Donation and The Human Organ Act (THOA). Students asked many relevant questions on the same and majority of them agreed on to pledge their organs. There was student who was from Iran and discussed about the scenario there. It was an amazing session and we look forward for such sessions in future.
