<h1 style="color: #191970;"><b>Sign Up to Be a Donor: Don't Rule Yourself Out</b></h1>
All people regardless of age should consider themselves potential organ and tissue donors. There are few absolute exclusions (such as HIV infection, active cancer, systemic infection) and no strict upper or lower age limits. Potential donors will be evaluated for suitability when the occasion arises.
<br><br><br><h1 style="color: #191970;"><b>Too Old?</b></h1>
No one is too old or too young. Both newborns and senior citizens have been organ donors. The condition of your organs is more important than age. Someone 35 years old with a history of alcohol abuse may have a liver that is in worse condition than someone 60 years old who has never consumed alcohol. Doctors will examine your organs and determine whether they are suitable for donation if the situation arises. If you are under 18, you may need the permission of a parent or guardian to donate.

<br><br><h1 style="color: #191970;"><b>Medical Condition?</b></h1>
You may still be able to donate your organs. Doctors will evaluate the condition of your organs when the time arises. The transplant team's decision will be based on a combination of factors such as your specific illness and your physical condition to determine which organs and tissues can be donated.
