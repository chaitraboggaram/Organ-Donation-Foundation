<br><br>MOHAN Foundation was invited by Mrs. Shanthi, HR personnel of Messrs. Rane (Madras) Limited, Pondicherry, to conduct an awareness session on organ donation for their employees. 
<br><br>On 20th December, 2014, Mrs. Lalitha Raghuram, Country Director of MOHAN Foundation made a presentation to the employees and spoke about when, what, where, how and why about organ donation.  The employees received the presentation very enthusiastically and asked several questions.  Mr. Raghuram was also present and responded to the queries.  Several employees picked up the donor card, and requested us to make a similar presentation to their employees in another campus in Pondicherry. 
<br><br>We thank Mrs. Shanthi and Dr. Vedapriya of Aarupadai Veedu Medical College, Pondicherry, for making this presentation possible.
