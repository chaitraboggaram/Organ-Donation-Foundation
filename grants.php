<h1>Grants and Research </h1>
HRSA's Division of Transplantation sponsors four grantee programs. While the focus of each program is different, all share the ultimate goal of increasing the number of organs for transplant.
<br><br>The four programs focus on issues such as: identifying and replicating successful strategies for increasing the number of registered donors; educating the public about living donation and its risks and benefits; and improving clinical methods for taking care of deceased donors while awaiting organ recovery. The fourth program supports a center to provide travel and related expenses for living donors who otherwise could not afford to travel to recipients' transplant programs. Not all programs are offered each year.
