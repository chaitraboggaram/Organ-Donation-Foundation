<big><big><b>A Swipe On Tinder App Can Make You a Organ Donor in England </b></big></big><br><br><br>
<big>The importance of organ donation and the need for increased donors is rising all over the world. As a part of its contribution to organ donation, the popular dating app, Tinder has collaborated with the NHS England to promote organ donation.

<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnybody can just register as an organ donor by using the Tinder app. The campaign will allow Tinder users to identify themselves as a support of organ donation on their profile, allowing those who also support organ donation to swipe right if they want to talk about the shortage of vital organs over a first date. Anyone who matches by swiping right on one of these profiles will get a special message that reads, "If only it was that easy for those in need of a life-saving organ to find a match" and directs to the NHS to sign up as an organ donor.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCelebrities, including U.K. Olympic gold medalist Jade Jones, are also joining the initiative and creating profiles to support organ donation awareness.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSally Johnson, director of organ donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said, "While a third of the UK population have registered their intention to donate on the NHS Organ Donor Register, millions more support donation but haven't taken the final step to sign up. With the help of these bespoke profiles on Tinder, we'll grab people's attention and throw a spotlight on the importance of organ donation.‚Äù
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Joining the register takes only a couple of minutes - about the same amount of time as a few swipes on Tinder. The best part is knowing that you could save or improve up to nine individuals' lives in the future," she added.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHermione Way, Tinder's head of European communications, said, 'While those swiping decisions are important and could be the first step to a successful relationship, we hope that the NHS profiles featuring Jamie, Jade and Gemma will encourage people to make and act upon a different decision too - to sign up as an organ donor.'
