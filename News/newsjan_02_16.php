<big><big><b>Health Ministry Issues Draft Guidelines for Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant in India</b></big></big><br><br><br>
<big>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the need for organ donation arises in India and lots of people have been donating cadavers, the health ministry has recently proposed a new set of criteria for donating deceased kidneys in the country.
<img src="" border="2" align="right">
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are rules and procedures for donating organs in India but it lacks criteria for donating and also many people involve in illegal trading of kidneys. The draft guidelines are aimed to focus on easing rules and procedures to encourage organ donation and also to rule out illegal trade and transplants involving the organ.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) under the Union Health Ministry has issued draft guidelines for allocating criteria for deceased donor kidney transplant.The draft guidelines have been posted on the NOTTO website and comments and suggestions have been invited to fine tune the guidelines till January 16," an official statement said.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe draft guidelines include various issues including recipient registration, listing and scoring system in the waiting list, allocation principles and algorithm, including criteria for urgent listing and inter-state issues.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"If no recipient is eligible in city waiting list then allocation will be done to state and then to other states in the ROTTO (Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization) and then to other ROTTO nationally," the draft said.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"This initiative reflects our commitment to promote organ donation in the country. We will finalize these guidelines after we receive various suggestions and comments on these draft guidelines. Once finalized, these guidelines will go a long way in promoting organ donation in the country," said health minister J P Nadda.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe added an agreement with state governments and healthcare institutions would be signed in due course to ensure implementation of the guidelines.
