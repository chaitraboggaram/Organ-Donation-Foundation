	</tr>
</table>
The objective of this project is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of informational (IM), testimonial (TM), or blended (BM) organ donation video messaging with adolescents during scheduled driver’s education classes. Classes will be randomized to receive one of the three interventions and 450 adolescent participants will complete questionnaires at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-week follow-up. The research team expects that adolescents in the IM and BM groups will show more robust effects of organ donation knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intention, and actual donor designation rates at the time of getting their driver’s license as compared to the IM adolescents. Additionally, they expect that the IM and BM interventions will have a more robust effect on adolescents communicating their donation intentions to their parent(s) and on parents’ willingness to authorize deceased donation for the adolescent. The proposed research is innovative because it examines an organ donation intervention in an underserved population (i.e., adolescents) with historically lower donor designation rates. This is an important population to target because it represents the first time they will be asked to join the donor registry and because individuals are unlikely to remove themselves from donor registries once already enrolled. Pairing organ donation education with driver’s education ensures that such messaging occurs in close proximity to the donation request at the RMV office. Findings from this study are expected to advance the science of organ donation messaging and to have a positive impact on organ donation designation rates in Massachusetts.

This study will evaluate the independent and combined effects of two organ donation education interventions on consent for donation among adolescents and their parents. High school students from northeastern Ohio will participate in 4-hour multi-modality education summits to educate them about donation and ways to discuss donation with their parents. Adolescents are an important group for organ donation efforts as they have not yet applied for a driver’s license and represent the donors of the future. Yet many organ donation interventions have not targeted adolescents. This research team hypothesizes that adolescents exposed to tailored organ donation interventions will be more willing than non-exposed adolescents to consent to donation and more comfortable discussing donation with their parents and caregivers.

		<th>Project Title:</th><td>	Maximizing donor registrations among Hispanics: A positive psychology approach</td>
</tr>
</table>
The proposed studies take a positive psychological approach toward increasing donor registration rates. While positive affect has long been associated with increased prosocial behavior such as charitable donations, the common understanding of emotions has recently become more nuanced. Feelings such as elevation (e.g., uplifted, inspired), serenity, gratitude, and happiness are now widely accepted as distinct emotions, with distinguishable characteristics. The first study predicts that positive emotions, in general, will be associated with increased donor registration rates compared to approaches that do not elicit positive emotion. It is hypothesized that different positive emotions are associated with different levels of donor registration rates. Specifically, elevation is posited to lead to significantly higher registration rates than feelings of gratitude or serenity. The second study continues to explore the relationship between positive emotions and organ donor registration. Organ donor campaigns often focus on the number of people in need of a donated organ, or the number people who die each day as a result of the organ shortage. Other campaigns focus on the lives saved through organ donation. In line with the predictions in the first study about the influence of elevation, it is proposed that the latter approach (i.e., focusing on the recipients) will lead to greater registration rates than focusing on the number in need or the number of people who have passed away. It is further proposed that this feeling of elevation, and its impact on donor registration rates, will be maximized when the recipient’s good character is highlighted.

This project seeks to increase the number of African American adults who go online to designate their consent to become organ donors in the Georgia state donor registry. This will be accomplished by creating a web-based version of an existing culturally-sensitive intervention (Project ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) to address barriers to organ and tissue donation among African Americans. This web-based version of the intervention will include five 3-minute video segments addressing commonly held negative beliefs about organ and tissue donation. Next, the research team will launch the Project ACTS II website and identify and train online participant recruiters to recruit 800 study participants into the study. Half of the participants will be randomized to view the control website (Donate Life, Georgia) whereas the other half will be randomized to view the Project ACTS II videos on the project website. Website usage statistics will be gathered to conduct a process evaluation. The outcome evaluation will test whether individuals visiting the ACTS II website demonstrate: a) significantly greater donation-related knowledge, b) more favorable attitudes and beliefs towards organ and tissue donation, and c) stronger intentions to join the state donor registry at immediate post-test compared to control participants as determined by baseline and immediate follow-up measures. The team will also test whether individuals visiting the ACTS II website are significantly more likely to join the Georgia state donor registry than control participants by the end of the study as determined by Donate Life Georgia registry data.

This research study examines the effectiveness of integrating an organ donation education component into existing evidence-based health education programs to increase the number of individuals who enroll on the Michigan Organ Donor Registry. For the purposes of this project, an additional session will be added to two evidence-based programs: the Stanford Chronic Disease Self Management Program (CDSMP) and the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Bonus sessions will be provided at week 7 for both of the evidence-based program workshops. Each of the participating workshops will be randomized into one of two groups. In the intervention group, the bonus session will consist of an organ donation education component as well as a healthy eating education component. The organ donation education component will be led by a donation advocate, a trained volunteer with a personal connection to organ donation. In the control group, the participants will receive a healthy eating/active living education component. The target population for this project is individuals participating in an evidence-based program (CDSMP or DPP) in five Michigan counties; many of these individuals will be over age 50, living with at least one chronic disease, and African American. The primary outcome measure for the project will be verified registrations on the Michigan Organ Donor Registry. This program is led by a consortium including the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan, Gift of Life Michigan and the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

</table>
The proportion of ethnic minorities, including Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders (ANHPI), on transplant waiting lists exceeds their representation in the general population. However, few ANHPI adults, including college students, are designated organ donors (DOD) on their driver’s licenses or in a donor registry. Taking advantage of college students’ frequent use of online technology, including social networking sites (e.g., Facebook) and social media sites (e.g., YouTube, Twitter), the research teamwill create an online intervention that leverages this technology to engage and educate ANHPI students about a range of topics related to organ donation (OD). These topics would “map onto” college courses on ethnic studies, ethics, anatomy, religion, etc. The intervention will provide culturally sensitive messages tailored to their interest in or wariness of organ donation and reframe students’ attitudes about OD and becoming a DOD. This project will test the impact of the online intervention tailored to college students at three universities in Hawaii via a multiple baseline delayed treatment design. The goals are to increase DOD rates in ANHPI college students and encourage peer discussions/interactions/advocacy about OD. Students and student organizations will participate in contests to win prizes (e.g., best term paper or 2-minute YouTube video on OD/DOD issues). Innovative online strategies that can engage, educate, and reframe DOD for college students, including those who find it unappealing (i.e., the “ick factor”) are clearly needed. Our online intervention will use the concept of “gamification” to turn college students’ learning and advocacy ideas surrounding OD/DOD into a contest with their peers.

</table>
This project proposes to increase the number of individuals who consent to deceased donation in New York State (NYS) by gaining a greater understanding of the decision making process in relation to registry enrollments via the voter registration process. The project represents a fully collaborative intervention between the New York Alliance for Donation, the four NYS organ procurement organizations (OPOs), three NYS eye and tissue banks, the University at Buffalo, and the League of Women Voters (a nonpartisan political organization that encourages informed and active participation in government through voting). In 2008, NYS became the first state to pass legislation requiring the inclusion of an organ and tissue donor enrollment section on voter registration forms, with phased implementation beginning in 2009. Since inception, nearly 125,000 individuals have enrolled in the New York State Donate Life Organ and Tissue Donor Registry via voter registration forms, representing nearly 4% of cumulative enrollments to date. In 2013, over 15% of all registry enrollments were made via voter registration forms, significantly decreasing the percentage of enrollments made via motor vehicle offices seen in prior years. Individuals will be targeted for enrollment utilizing standard NYS voter registration forms at community-based voter registration drives. The project aims to increase by 5% the expected average enrollment gain in the state registry and to increase by 34% the percentage of individuals who enroll in the registry using the voter registration process.

		<th>Project Title:</th><td>	A Positive Deviance Approach to Increasing Familial Consent Rates</td>
</tr>
</table>
This project addresses the documented negative association between Organ Procurement Coordinators’ (OPCs) familial consent rates and racial/ethnic diversity of donation service area. The Positive Deviance (PD) approach provides a theoretical framework for the project. PD indicates that within any community there exist individuals who enact specific behaviors that allow them to thrive despite surrounding circumstances. The project will identify novel communication behaviors employed by OPCs who maintain high consent rates despite being located in racially/ethnically diverse areas (i.e., PD behaviors) and will disseminate such strategies among participating Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) toward the goal of improving familial communication and subsequent consent rates. The PD approach encourages OPCs to be active participants in each stage of intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. During the first year of the project, OPCs at 11 participating OPOs will complete interviews designed to identify PD behaviors. A proportion of these OPCs will also participate in a collaborative workshop designed to clarify the meaning of identified PD behaviors and will assist in creating an educational video for dissemination across participating OPOs that discusses and demonstrates such behaviors. During years two and three of the project, participating OPCs will complete educational sessions and refresher courses that employ a variety of active learning methods to increase knowledge of PD behaviors. Project success will be tracked by measuring OPCs’ quarterly consent rates and by examining the association between OPCs’ self-reported use of PD behaviors with familial consent and case characteristics.

		<th>Project Title:</th><td>	The Effect Of An eLearning Approach To Hospital Development On Organ Donation Authorization Rates</td>
</tr>
</table>
This study will develop and test a new approach to educating hospital staff involved in the organ donation process. In many hospitals, OPO staff is not able to reach all staff in person and must rely in part on the hospital’s orientation process to address organ donation. This is typically done as part of a longer presentation, with only a few minutes dedicated to organ donation. The high turnover rate in the nursing profession, especially in the stressful environment of the critical care unit, leads to inconsistent and potentially inadequate knowledge and understanding of the organ donation process. Building on our CME accredited online course for primary care providers, we will develop a new version for use in hospitals. The course will be designed to be relevant for all staff that comes into contact with the organ donation and recovery process – physicians, nurses, social workers, and chaplains. eLearning programs are highly valued by organizations and individual participants due to the low cost, consistency, and flexibility. We hypothesize that in hospitals where all eligible staff has had consistent, up to date training, the environment will be more positively disposed toward donation, and there will be fewer process breakdowns that lead to loss of potential donors, leading to a higher number of donors and higher authorization rate.

</table>
This study builds on prior work that developed and tested the Communicating Effectively about Donation (CEaD) training program, a communication skills training program that successfully increased the consent rates of OPO staff who request deceased organ donation at 8 OPOs located around the United States. The purpose of this project is to conduct an effectiveness and implementation study based on the principles of the RE-AIM model (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). One of the unique aspects of the approach is the intent to create capacity in OPOs for assessment and training for sustained and constant improvement once this project is completed. The CEaD does not necessarily supplant local or intensive on-site programs, rather, it provides OPOs with the capacity to allow busy OPO staff to learn and review evidence-based communication skills on a regular and consistent basis and in accordance with their work schedules. The aims of the study are to: (1) Re-package the CEaD as a wholly self-contained communication skills training tool that provides basic and continuous training for any OPO staff to use; (2) Test the uptake and acceptability of the CEaD2 outside the confines of a randomized clinical trial by implementing a social marketing campaign; (3) Test the effectiveness of the CEaD2 training program to improve communication skills and increase authorization to organ donation.

This project will test the effectiveness of disseminating a living donation kidney transplant (LDKT) education program called Explore Transplant (ET) by partnering with a large health insurance organization to deliver video-guided transplant education supported by telephone and mail. The Missouri Kidney Program (MoKP) is a state-wide organization who subsidizes the costs of dialysis medication for low-income ESRD patients, thus they operate as an insurance company. With 900 MoKP dialysis patients, we will conduct an eight-month, group randomized controlled trial (GRCT) where 600 patients will be randomized to receive: (1) no additional transplant education; (2) a video-guided, four-part ET program (Patient-guided education); or (3) a video-guided ET program with discussion facilitated by a case manager (Case-Manager guided). The grant aims are to understand the transplant educational needs and barriers to learning faced by low-income Black and White ESRD patients and improve LDKT knowledge. At the conclusion of this study, we will have assessed how different educational delivery strategies common to health insurance companies affect ESRD patients’ informed LDKT decision-making and developed a set of recommendations for ideal transplant education dissemination nationally by health insurance programs.
